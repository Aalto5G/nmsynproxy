There are several inspirations for this software that are acknowledged here.

The SYN cookie implementation is inspired by the excellent FreeBSD
implementation. It is believed that since ideas cannot be copyrighted, this
does not make the independent implementation copyrighted by FreeBSD kernel
copyright holders.

The SYN proxy is inspired by other similar SYN proxy features, such as
OpenBSD's PF SYN proxy and Linux kernel iptables SYN proxy. The same is true
here: ideas cannot be copyrighted, and therefore, this is not a derivative
work.
