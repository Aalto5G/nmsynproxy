What if ACK response to SYN+ACK is dropped? The protected host may retry, and
we must be prepared to re-send ACK.

What client tries to re-send old data that server has ACKed and firewall
has seen the ACK but the ack was dropped between firewall and client? Now
the old data is dropped, and therefore, the server never gets a chance to
ACK.
- Solution: allow retransmit not more than one max_window back
- - Have to keep track of max_window
