What if ACK response to SYN+ACK is dropped? The protected host may retry, and
we must be prepared to re-send ACK.

What client tries to re-send old data that server has ACKed and firewall
has seen the ACK but the ack was dropped between firewall and client? Now
the old data is dropped, and therefore, the server never gets a chance to
ACK.
- Solution: allow retransmit not more than one max_window back
- - Have to keep track of max_window

RST attack
- require exact or +1 match, need to maintain seqlo/seqhi values where
  seqlo is max sent and seqhi is max ACKed + window. Then we allow resending
  up to 1 window back, i.e. seqlo-max_window .. seqhi

Enforce at least that window size must be 1. If it's 0, round up to 1.
